/**
  @mainpage EcoEvo Simulator: EES
  The EcoEvo Simulator (EES) is a cellular automaton algorithm that can be used to simulate patterns of distribution, speciation, and extinction for virtual species in response to dynamic climate on various spatial and temporal scales. The framework builds on a model first introduced by Qiao et al (2016) in the American Naturalist. 
  
  <br>The source code is shared via a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion' target='_blank'>subversion repository</a>. 
  Anyone can download and play with the simulation via svn://mmweb.animal.net.cn/nb_icesheet/trunk
